# Machine-learning-and-statistical-methods-with-R


This folder contains projects from the book An Introduction to Statistical Learning with applications to R, by James, G. and others. 


********************************
Project 1 - Linear regression: This chapter is concerned with prediction based on continues data sets and inferens analysis, that is decide weather there exists a relationship between the target and the predictors,
if so how strong is it? Which predictor affect the target the most and how precisely can we estimate the effect of each predictor? How well can we predict the target? Is there a linear relationship between the predictors and the target? Is there synergy effects? These are some of the questions that are adresses in these projects. 

The projects are: 

chap3_lab.r : We get familiar with some (a very small part) of the functionaly for doing linear regression. 

chap3_sec7_ex8.r: We consider the Auto data set in the ISLR library in R to answer a series of questions about the predictors and perform a linear regression based on one predictor. 

chap3_sec7_ex9.r: Next we expand our project on the Auto data set to the multivariate case, including experiments with different transformations of the predictors. 

chap3_sec7_ex10.r: We consider the Carseat data set from the ISLR library and perform multivariate regression.
